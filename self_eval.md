# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

When you have multiple paths a code can follow, or when trying to narrow down a problem to find a solution.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would ask questions before I started instead of just taking it head on and waiting until I got stuck to ask questions.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

I was impressed with my resourcefulness when it came to finding solutions via Google. I usually get frustrated quickly when I dont get results to the questions I'm asking, and I did a good job of asking the right questions.
